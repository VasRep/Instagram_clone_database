# üì∏ Instagram Demo Database Project

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **relational Instagram-like database** using **MySQL**.  
It includes **data preprocessing with Python**, **SQL schema creation**, **constraints**, **triggers**, **views**, and **analytical queries**.

The goal is to simulate the structure and functionality of a social media platform while applying advanced **SQL concepts** such as **CTEs**, **window functions**, and **trigger-based automation**.

## üßÆ Dataset Creation

The dataset was inspired by typical Instagram user interactions ‚Äî users, photos, likes, comments, and follows.  
All CSV files in the dataset folder, which are used to populate the database, were **generated with the assistance of ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, providing realistic sample data for testing and demonstration.

## üêç Python Data Preprocessing

**File:** `modifying_keywords.py`

This Python script processes the nested `keywords.csv` file, which contains JSON-like data.  
It normalizes this structure into two flat relational tables ‚Äî a process similar to data warehousing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).

### Transformation Logic
- Reads `keywords.csv` from `/in/`
- Parses the nested JSON strings safely using `ast.literal_eval`
- Creates two new tables:
  - `tags.csv` ‚Äî contains tag (keyword) IDs and names  
  - `photo_tags.csv` ‚Äî maps photos to their corresponding tags
- Saves the resulting CSVs to the `/out/` folder.

The new CSVs are then used in the database to define the **many-to-many relationship** between photos and tags.

## üß± Database Schema

After generating and cleaning the data, all CSVs were imported into MySQL Workbench.

### üßæ Tables Overview

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **users** | User profiles containing `id`, `username`, `created_at`, `age` |
| **photos** | Stores photos uploaded by users (`id`, `image_url`, `user_id`) |
| **likes** | Tracks which users liked which photos |
| **comments** | Contains all user comments per photo |
| **follows** | Defines following relationships between users |
| **unfollows** | Logs users who unfollow others (created via trigger) |
| **tags** | List of hashtags  |
| **photo_tags** | Many-to-many link between photos and tags |

All tables were designed by the author to model realistic Instagram data behavior.

## üß© SQL Files Structure

The `sql/` folder contains organized scripts for schema creation, constraint setup, triggers, views, and analytical queries.

1. **create_database.sql**  
   Defines the tables and initial schema.

2. **alter_tables.sql**  
   Adds primary keys, unique constraints, FKs, and cascading rules.

3. **triggers.sql**  
   Implements business logic automation.

4. **views.sql**  
   Defines reusable database views (e.g., tag statistics).

5. **queries.sql**  
   Analytical queries, CTEs, and reports.

###  `create_database.sql`
Defines all tables, including:
- `users`, `photos`, `likes`, `comments`, `follows`, `unfollows`, `tags`, and `photo_tags`.

###  `alter_tables.sql`
Adds relational integrity:
- Primary and foreign keys
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` relationships to maintain referential consistency

###  `views.sql`
Defines database **views** for easier reporting.  

### `triggers.sql`

| Trigger Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **must_be_adult** | Blocks inserting users younger than 18 |
| **prevent_self_follows** | Prevents users from following themselves |
| **create_unfollow** | Automatically records unfollows into the `unfollows` table |


### `queries.sql`
Contains SQL analytics and insights using aggregations, CTEs, and window functions:
1. **5 Oldest Users**  
2. **Most Popular Photo**  
3. **Average Posts Per User**  
4. **Top 5 Hashtags**  
5. **Users Who Liked Every Photo**  
6. **Top 3 Most-Liked Photos Per User (Using `DENSE_RANK()`)**

The file ERD.pdf visualizes the database schema ‚Äî showing all entities, relationships, and key constraints.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

---

### 1. Import Data
- Prepare your MySQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench or command line).
- Use the **"Table Data Import Wizard"** in MySQL Workbench to load all CSV files from the `/dataset/` directory into the corresponding database tables.

---

### 2. Run SQL Scripts
Execute the SQL scripts in the correct order from the `/sql/` folder to build and initialize the database.

**Execution Order:**
1. **create_database.sql** ‚Äî Defines tables and the initial database schema.  
2. **alter_tables.sql** ‚Äî Adds primary keys, unique constraints, foreign keys, and cascading rules.  
3. **triggers.sql** ‚Äî Implements automation.  
4. **views.sql** ‚Äî Defines reusable database views (e.g., tag statistics).  
5. **queries.sql** ‚Äî Contains analytical queries, CTEs, and reports.
