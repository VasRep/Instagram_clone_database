# 📸 Instagram Demo Database Project

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **relational Instagram-like database** using **MySQL**.  
It includes **data preprocessing with Python**, **SQL schema creation**, **constraints**, **triggers**, **views**, and **analytical queries**.

The goal is to simulate the structure and functionality of a social media platform while applying advanced **SQL concepts** such as **CTEs**, **window functions**, and **trigger-based automation**.

## 🧮 Dataset Creation

The dataset was inspired by typical Instagram user interactions — users, photos, likes, comments, and follows.  
All CSV files in the dataset folder, which are used to populate the database, were **generated with the assistance of ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, providing realistic sample data for testing and demonstration.

## 🐍 Python Data Preprocessing

**File:** `modifying_keywords.py`

This Python script processes the nested `keywords.csv` file, which contains JSON-like data.  
It normalizes this structure into two flat relational tables — a process similar to data warehousing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).

### Transformation Logic
- Reads `keywords.csv` from `/in/`
- Parses the nested JSON strings safely using `ast.literal_eval`
- Creates two new tables:
  - `tags.csv` — contains tag (keyword) IDs and names  
  - `photo_tags.csv` — maps photos to their corresponding tags
- Saves the resulting CSVs to the `/out/` folder.

The new CSVs are then used in the database to define the **many-to-many relationship** between photos and tags.

## 🧱 Database Schema

After generating and cleaning the data, all CSVs were imported into MySQL Workbench.

### 🧾 Tables Overview

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **users** | User profiles containing `id`, `username`, `created_at`, `age` |
| **photos** | Stores photos uploaded by users (`id`, `image_url`, `user_id`) |
| **likes** | Tracks which users liked which photos |
| **comments** | Contains all user comments per photo |
| **follows** | Defines following relationships between users |
| **unfollows** | Logs users who unfollow others (created via trigger) |
| **tags** | List of hashtags  |
| **photo_tags** | Many-to-many link between photos and tags |

All tables were designed by the author to model realistic Instagram data behavior.

## 🧩 SQL Files Structure

The `sql/` folder contains organized scripts for schema creation, constraint setup, triggers, views, and analytical queries.

1. **create_database.sql**  
   Defines the tables and initial schema.

2. **alter_tables.sql**  
   Adds primary keys, unique constraints, FKs, and cascading rules.

3. **triggers.sql**  
   Implements business logic automation.

4. **views.sql**  
   Defines reusable database views (e.g., tag statistics).

5. **queries.sql**  
   Analytical queries, CTEs, and reports.

###  `create_database.sql`
Defines all tables, including:
- `users`, `photos`, `likes`, `comments`, `follows`, `unfollows`, `tags`, and `photo_tags`.

###  `alter_tables.sql`
Adds relational integrity:
- Primary and foreign keys
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` relationships to maintain referential consistency

###  `views.sql`
Defines database **views** for easier reporting.  

### `triggers.sql`

| Trigger Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **must_be_adult** | Blocks inserting users younger than 18 |
| **prevent_self_follows** | Prevents users from following themselves |
| **create_unfollow** | Automatically records unfollows into the `unfollows` table |


### `queries.sql`
Contains SQL analytics and insights using aggregations, CTEs, and window functions:
1. **5 Oldest Users**  
2. **Most Popular Photo**  
3. **Average Posts Per User**  
4. **Top 5 Hashtags**  
5. **Users Who Liked Every Photo**  
6. **Top 3 Most-Liked Photos Per User (Using `DENSE_RANK()`)**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Create the Database Schema
- Open MySQL Workbench (or your preferred SQL client).
- Run the script **`create_database.sql`** from the `/sql/` folder.  
  This defines the initial database structure.

### 2. Import Data
- After the tables are created, use the **“Table Data Import Wizard”** in MySQL Workbench.  
- Import all CSV files from the `/dataset/` directory into their corresponding tables:  
  - `users.csv` → `users`  
  - `photos.csv` → `photos`  
  - `likes.csv` → `likes`  
  - `comments.csv` → `comments`  
  - `follows.csv` → `follows`  
  - `tags.csv` → `tags` 
  - `photo_tags.csv` → `photo_tags`  

### 3. Run SQL Scripts
Execute the SQL scripts in the correct order from the `/sql/` folder to build and initialize the database.

**Execution Order:**
1. **alter_tables.sql** — Adds primary keys, unique constraints, foreign keys, and cascading rules.  
2. **triggers.sql** — Implements automation.  
3. **views.sql** — Defines reusable database views (e.g. tag_stats).  
4. **queries.sql** — Contains analytical queries, CTEs, and reports.
